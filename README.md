# EVE Plugin SDK for Go

This SDK enables building [EVE] backend plugins using Go.

## Current state

This SDK is still in development. The protocol between the EVE server and the plugin SDK is considered stable, but we might introduce breaking changes in the SDK. This means that plugins using the older SDK should work with EVE, but might lose out on new features and capabilities that we introduce in the SDK.
